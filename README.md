# Gilroy Fire Operations Dashboard — Clean Rebuild

This repository was rebuilt from a blank folder. Only verified department data and image assets were carried forward.

## Deploy to Render
1. Replace the contents of the GitHub repository with every file and folder in this package.
2. Commit the replacement.
3. In Render, choose **Manual Deploy → Clear build cache & deploy**.
4. The health check is `/health`.

## Editable data
- Historical metrics and unit tiles: `data/historical.json`
- Mutual aid: `aid_received_ytd` and `aid_given_ytd`
- Deployments: `deployments` array

## Live sources
The backend tries the public PulsePoint endpoint first and then the OurGilroy public incident feed as a fallback. Weather and alerts use the National Weather Service.

## Interactive 2025 Annual Report

The dashboard now includes a dedicated annual report viewer at:

```text
/annual-report
```

Features include all 28 report slides, chapter navigation, full-screen viewing, keyboard controls, touch swiping, mouse-wheel navigation, and a printable PDF. The viewer deliberately displays exported PowerPoint page 2 first because that page is the designed cover; the original deck stores the Chapter 01 divider as page 1.

Annual report assets are located in:

```text
static/annual-report/slides/
static/reports/
```
